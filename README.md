# Earthquake-App
Using this Earthquake application(App name- QuakeReport), we can get important information of an earthquake like Magnitude,Location,Date and Time.

I have used USGS website for fetching the information: https://www.usgs.gov/
# Overview of APP
Using this QuakeReport App initially on the App screen we can see 4 inforamtion about the earthquake that are Magnitude,Location,Date and Time. If user wants more information about the earthquake then just click on the particular erathquake it will redirect the user to the official website of USGS goverment from where the informations are being fetched.

Note This app shows the recent earthquake which has occured recently in the world. (This app can be modified to display Top 10 or Top 20 etc. eartquake by making little changes in the code.)
# Learning from this Project
This project is about integrating various ideas and skills of Android Development which we are learing the practicing. 
Below are the skills which I learned through this project:

1 Connecting the Appliaction to Internate

2 Parsing the response of an API(Using JSON)

3 Intent for switching between the apps

4 Handling the Thread (Basic level only One thread handled)

5 For better memory usage I used Loader

6 Handled different cases like when is No internate connection, If the response from the API is null,display progress bar if internate speed is slow etc.
